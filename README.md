ReactQuiz - RED ACADEMY: Project 2

Project Summary

This was the second project completed as a part of RED ACADEMY's front-end web developer program. Our goal was, building upon the basic skills learned in the past 2 weeks, to implement the pulling of api information from the New York Times database, display the information in a clear and concise manner, and provide both error and loading information to the user.
The site was built to be responsive by implementing a mobile first design.

Languages and tools used:

HTML
CSS (with a CSS reset styles, and media queries
Mobile first approach to design & coding (Responsive Web Design)
Git
.json
api
javascript
flexboxes

What did I learn?

This project was my third opportunity to exercise the HTML and CSS skills taught throughout the first two weeks of web development training and the first to include self written javascript. Having completed the first project I was feeling confident with regards to styling and was eager to dive into a new layer with regards to coding.
